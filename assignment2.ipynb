    "In this project we will analyze a dataset of user's rate my professor ratings and predict what rating a user will give to a certain professor. Our data set contains 5 features: professor name, review text, rating, difficulty and time/date the review was written.\n",

    "Relevant baselines to compare to our prediction models to would be a naive model which only predicts the global mean for each professor. We will calculate the global mean of the entire data set (ie.. every rating of every professor) for the baseline prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure the validity of our model, we will compare the RMSE, MSE, and MAE of our model in comparison to the naive mean prediction to ensure that our model performs better than than the baseline. Additionally, we will train the model on a subset of the data set and allocate another portion as our test set to guarantee that our model works for data it has not yet been trained on which is a direct indicator of it's real world performance.
